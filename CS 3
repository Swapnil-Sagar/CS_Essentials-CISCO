                                                            What is Malware?
                                                            
 Malicious software, or malware, is a term used to describe software designed to disrupt computer operations, 
 or gain access to computer systems, without the user's knowledge or permission.      
 
 Viruses

A virus is malicious executable code attached to another executable file, such as a legitimate program. 
Most viruses require end-user initiation, and can activate at a specific time or date. Computer viruses usually 
spread in one of three ways: from removable media; from downloads off the Internet; and from email attachments.

Worms

Worms are malicious code that replicates by independently exploiting vulnerabilities in networks. Worms usually slow down networks.
Whereas a virus requires a host program to run, worms can run by themselves.


Trojan horse

A Trojan horse is malware that carries out malicious operations under the guise of a desired operation such as playing an online game. 
This malicious code exploits the privileges of the user that runs it. A Trojan horse differs from a virus because the Trojan binds 
itself to non-executable files, such as image files, audio files, or games.

Logic Bombs

A logic bomb is a malicious program that uses a trigger to awaken the malicious code. For example, triggers can be dates, times, 
other programs running, or the deletion of a user account. The logic bomb remains inactive until that trigger event happens. 
Once activated, a logic bomb implements a malicious code that causes harm to a computer. A logic bomb can sabotage database
records, erase files, and attack operating systems or applications. 


Ransomware

Ransomware holds a computer system, or the data it contains, captive until the target makes a payment.
Ransomware usually works by encrypting data in the computer with a key unknown to the user.


Backdoors

A backdoor refers to the program or code introduced by a criminal who has compromised a system. The backdoor bypasses the normal 
authentication used to access a system. A few common backdoor programs are Netbus and Back Orifice, which both allow remote 
access to unauthorized system users. The purpose of the backdoor is to grant the cyber criminals future access to the system 
even if the organization fixes the original vulnerability used to attack the system.


Rootkits

A rootkit modifies the operating system to create a backdoor. Attackers then use the backdoor to access the computer remotely. 
Most rootkits take advantage of software vulnerabilities to perform privilege escalation and modify system files


Spam

Spam, also known as junk mail, is unsolicited email.



Spyware

Spyware is software that enables a criminal to obtain information about a userâ€™s computer activities.
Spyware often includes activity trackers, keystroke collection, and data capture.



Adware

Adware typically displays annoying pop-ups to generate revenue for its authors. The malware may analyze user interests by tracking
the websites visited.


Scareware

Scareware persuades the user to take a specific action based on fear. Scareware forges pop-up windows that resemble operating 
system dialogue windows. These windows convey forged messages stating that the system is at risk or needs the execution of a 
specific program to return to normal operation. In reality, no problems exist, and if the user agrees and allows the mentioned
program to execute, malware infects his or her system
