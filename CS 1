Our networks are particularly difficult to secure for a number of reasons:

Networks are increasingly integrated and complex.
Networks are connected to physical devices.
Cyber criminals can access networks from anywhere in the world.


 Here are just a few of the specialties you might consider for your career:

Cybersecurity Specialist
Cybersecurity Forensic Expert
Information Security Expert
Ethical Hacker

Overview of the Cybersecurity Domains
The word ‘domain’ has many meanings. Wherever there is control, authority, or protection, you might consider that 'area' to be a domain.

New technologies, such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) and the Internet of Things (IoT), have emerged. These new technologies
can track the health of trees in a neighborhood.They can provide up-to-date locations of vehicles, devices, individuals and materials. 
This type of information can save energy, improve efficiencies, and reduce safety risks. Each of these technologies will also result 
in exponentially expanding the amount of data collected, analyzed and used to understand the world. The data collected by GIS and IoE
poses a tremendous challenge for cybersecurity professionals in the future. The type of data generated by these devices has the 
potential to enable cyber criminals to gain access to very intimate aspects of daily life.



Heckers:

Amateurs
Amateurs, or script kiddies, have little or no skill, often using existing tools or instructions found on the Internet to 
launch attacks.


Hackers
This group of criminals breaks into computers or networks to gain access for various reasons. The intent of the break-in determines 
the classification of these attackers as white, gray, or black hats. White hat attackers break into networks or computer systems to
discover weaknesses in order to improve the security of these systems. The owners of the system give permission to perform the 
break-in, and they receive the results of the test. On the other hand, black hat attackers take advantage of any vulnerability 
for illegal personal, financial or political gain. Gray hat attackers are somewhere between white and black hat attackers. 
The gray hat attackers may find a vulnerability and report it to the owners of the system if that action coincides with their 
agenda. Some gray hat hackers publish the facts about the vulnerability on the Internet, so that other attackers can exploit it.


Organized Hackers
These criminals include organizations of cyber criminals, hacktivists, terrorists, and state-sponsored hackers. 
Cyber criminals are usually groups of professional criminals focused on control, power, and wealth. The criminals
are highly sophisticated and organized, and may even provide cybercrime as a service. Hacktivists make political 
statements to create awareness to issues that are important to them. Hacktivists publically publish embarrassing 
information about their victims.

Hacking started in the ‘60s with phone freaking (or phreaking) which refers to using various audio frequencies to manipulate 
phone systems. In the mid-‘80s, criminals used computer dial-up modems to connect computers to networks and used password-cracking 
programs to gain access to data.


Modern Terms:

1)Script Kiddies - First used in 1990 and refers to teenagers of inexperience hackers running exixting scripts, tools , and 
                   exploits that could cause harm
                   
2)Vulnerability Broker -  These are usually grey hat hackers who attempts to discover exploits and report them to vendors, sometimes 
                            for rewards
                            
3)Hacktivists - These are Gray hat hackers who rally and protest against different political and social ideas. They publically 
                protests against organisations or govt by posting articles , videos , leaked sensitive information, 
                and performing distributed denial of service(DDOS) attacks.
           
4)Cyber Criminals- These are black hat hackers who are either self emploied of work for large cyber crime organisations 
                    
5)State- Sponsored - Depending on the persons perspective these are either white hat hackers or black hat hackers who steals 
                      govt secrets, gather intelligence, and sabotage networks. Their targets are foreign govenments, terrorist
                      groups, and corporations
